If you inject canaries but never watch them, they provide no signal. If you monitor for canaries that were never inserted, there is nothing to detect.</p><h5>Step 1: Build stealthy canaries from real samples</h5><p>Start from legitimate examples so the canaries preserve normal length, tone, and feature distribution.
