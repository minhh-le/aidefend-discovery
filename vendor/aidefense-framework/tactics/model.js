                        "Systematically catalog, govern, and manage the lifecycle of all agentic AI skills installed across an organization's agent platforms (e.g., OpenClaw <code>SKILL.md</code>, Claude Code <code>skill.json</code>, Cursor <code>manifest.json</code>, and similar platform-specific skill/plugin artifacts).<br/><br/><strong>Why skills need dedicated inventory:</strong> Skills are reusable behavioral packages that encode multi-step workflows including tool orchestration, file-system and network access, and persistent memory writes. Unlike traditional software packages or individual AI tools, skills operate as autonomous behavioral units that can execute with broad contextual access within their host agent unless bounded by manifest and runtime controls — making each installed skill an independent attack surface with its own blast radius.<br/><br/><strong>What this establishes:</strong><ul><li>Centralized visibility across all agent platforms</li><li>Approval-gated installation workflows</li><li>Event-driven lifecycle management (ownership transfer, dormancy detection, incident-triggered disable)</li><li>Orphaned-skill detection and remediation</li></ul>Without a comprehensive skill inventory, downstream technical controls — permission manifest enforcement (<code>AID-H-019.007</code>), admission scanning (<code>AID-H-031</code>), identity-file protection (<code>AID-I-004.006</code>) — lack the foundational data layer needed to operate at enterprise scale.<br/><br/><strong>Scope boundary with siblings:</strong><ul><li><strong>vs AID-M-001.001</strong> — M-001.001 catalogs static infrastructure assets (models, datasets, hardware). This sub-technique catalogs dynamic behavioral assets (skills) with independent permission scopes, supply-chain origins, and persistent-state modification capabilities.</li><li><strong>vs AID-H-004 / AID-E-001</strong> — Credential issuance, rotation, and revocation mechanics are owned by those families; this sub-technique provides the inventory data and lifecycle triggers they consume.</li><li><strong>vs AID-D-005.004</strong> — Audit log structure and collection are owned by D-005.004; this sub-technique defines the correlation key (skill ID/version) that enables log-to-inventory joins.</li></ul>",

Treat outputs as sensitive, retain hashes by default, and destroy raw leaked text after analyst review unless policy requires short-term evidence retention.</p>

<h5>Step 1: Probe for memorization with a concrete local inference client</h5><p>The example below uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint so it can run against local gateways such as vLLM or a quarantined internal inference service.</p>

<h5>Step 2: Extract candidate motifs from leaked text</h5><p>Cluster the leaked samples with character n-gram TF-IDF and DBSCAN. The representative motif from each cluster becomes a candidate trigger for the behavioral-delta phase.</p>

<h5>Step 3: Score triggered versus clean behavior before promotion</h5><p>Do <em>not</em> fail a model purely because it memorizes text. Compare behavior on a fixed evaluation suite with and without candidate motifs, and fail promotion only if risk deltas exceed model-family thresholds.</p>

            "description": "Define exactly <em>how autonomous an agent is allowed to be</em> before it goes live, then enforce that decision at runtime. In plain terms, this technique answers four questions: <strong>(1)</strong> what kind of agent is this, <strong>(2)</strong> which behaviors may it perform autonomously, <strong>(3)</strong> which actions always require approval or are outright forbidden, and <strong>(4)</strong> how do we prove who authorized the agent and any later goal changes. This is not a vague maturity model. It is a concrete governance profile that product, security, and platform teams can approve, version, and enforce.<p><strong>Shortest possible summary:</strong> M-009 is a closed-loop control system for agent authority. First you approve the mission and limits. Then you bind them to an accountable runtime identity. Then every action is checked against those limits. Then monitoring can narrow authority further. Then every mission change and rollback leaves evidence.</p><h5>System View - how the pieces fit together</h5><div class=\"technique-table-wrap\"><table class=\"technique-inline-table\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Layer in the chain</th><th scope=\"col\">What this layer decides or proves</th><th scope=\"col\">Main artifact or mechanism</th><th scope=\"col\">Concrete example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1. Mission approval</strong></td><td>What the agent is for, and how much agency it is allowed to have.</td><td>Signed goal manifest + operating scope + autonomy profile.</td><td><code>support-agent-v3</code> may answer support questions and create tickets, but refunds and credential changes are out of scope.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2. Runtime identity</strong></td><td>Which exact agent instance is acting, on whose authority, with which credentials.</td><td>Agent registration, owner/sponsor record, workload identity, short-lived task-scoped credentials.</td><td><code>support-agent-prod-001</code> gets a 15-minute credential for ticket actions only.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3. Action gate</strong></td><td>Whether this specific action is allowed, supervised, or forbidden right now.</td><td>Authority envelope + tool classification + policy engine decision.</td><td><code>search_kb</code> is allowed, <code>send_email</code> escalates for approval, <code>issue_refund</code> is denied.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Runtime containment</strong></td><td>How the system reacts when behavior becomes risky or abnormal.</td><td>Runtime trust state with automatic demotion rules.</td><td>If anomaly signals rise, the agent moves from <code>normal</code> to <code>restricted</code> and becomes read-only.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5. Change control and recovery</strong></td><td>Who changed the mission, who approved it, and how to revert safely.</td><td>Quorum approval, signed promotion record, rollback checkpoint, immutable provenance.</td><td>Moving from <code>support-agent-v3</code> to <code>support-agent-v4</code> requires product + security approval and can be rolled back to the last known-good digest.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Why this is systemic defense:</strong> each layer depends on the one before it. If you skip mission approval, runtime policy has nothing authoritative to enforce. If you skip identity, you cannot prove who acted. If you skip the action gate, the approved limits are not enforced. If you skip trust-state demotion, the system cannot shrink authority during live risk. If you skip provenance and rollback, bad goal changes become hard to investigate and hard to undo.</p><h5>Quick Example - Customer Support Agent</h5><p>Suppose <code>support-agent-prod-001</code> can read the knowledge base, summarize tickets, draft a reply, and open an internal support ticket. That does <strong>not</strong> automatically mean it may send customer emails, issue refunds, rotate credentials, or delegate the task to another agent. M-009 is the technique that turns those differences into an enforceable control system instead of an informal expectation.</p><h5>Autonomy Behavior Categories - how to classify actions</h5><div class=\"technique-table-wrap\"><table class=\"technique-inline-table\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">What it means</th><th scope=\"col\">Plain-language examples</th><th scope=\"col\">Typical default posture</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Observe</strong></td><td>Read or collect information without changing anything.</td><td>Read a ticket, search the KB, inspect an order record, fetch a dashboard.</td><td>Usually safe to automate if data scope is already allowed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Analyze</strong></td><td>Interpret or transform information without causing a side effect.</td><td>Summarize a ticket, classify severity, detect sentiment, rank next steps.</td><td>Usually safe to automate, but still bounded by data sensitivity rules.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Decide</strong></td><td>Choose which allowed path should happen next.</td><td>Decide whether a case should be escalated, choose a template, decide whether approval is needed.</td><td>Often supervised when the decision changes user outcome, cost, or risk.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Execute</strong></td><td>Perform a side effect in a system or in the outside world.</td><td>Send an email, create or close a ticket, update a CRM field, call a payment API, run a shell command.</td><td>High-risk category. Usually supervised unless the action is tightly bounded and low impact.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Delegate</strong></td><td>Hand work to another agent, workflow, or privileged service.</td><td>Ask a billing agent to continue, invoke a code agent, trigger a security workflow.</td><td>Usually supervised because delegation can silently expand scope and blast radius.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persist</strong></td><td>Write state that will influence future behavior.</td><td>Save long-term memory, store a customer preference, write to a task queue, modify an agent profile or reusable plan.</td><td>Usually supervised because bad writes can create durable security or safety drift.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Fast classification rule:</strong> if the action only reads, it is usually <em>Observe</em>; if it interprets, it is <em>Analyze</em>; if it chooses, it is <em>Decide</em>; if it changes a system, user, or real-world state, it is <em>Execute</em>; if it hands control elsewhere, it is <em>Delegate</em>; if it writes future-affecting state, it is <em>Persist</em>.</p><h5>Operating Scope - simple interpretation</h5><div class=\"technique-table-wrap\"><table class=\"technique-inline-table\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Scope</th><th scope=\"col\">What the agent may do</th><th scope=\"col\">Easy example</th><th scope=\"col\">What is still blocked or gated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>No Agency</strong></td><td>The system answers questions only. No tool calls, no state changes, no delegation.</td><td>A chatbot that explains refund policy but cannot touch any backend system.</td><td>Everything beyond answering and retrieval.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Prescribed Agency</strong></td><td>The agent may follow a narrow, pre-defined workflow, usually read-heavy and low-risk.</td><td>Read KB articles, summarize a support ticket, and draft an internal response.</td><td>External actions, durable writes, high-impact decisions, open-ended delegation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Supervised Agency</strong></td><td>The agent may prepare or propose higher-impact actions, but a human or policy gate must approve them.</td><td>Prepare a refund email or CRM update, but do not send or commit it without approval.</td><td>Any action that changes money, identity, production state, or customer-visible outcomes without approval.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Full Agency</strong></td><td>The agent may autonomously execute approved low-risk actions within a tightly bounded envelope.</td><td>Open or update low-risk support tickets automatically during business hours for a single product line.</td><td>Refund issuance, credential changes, bulk exports, production admin actions, and unapproved delegation still remain supervised or forbidden.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5>How one governed action flows through the system</h5><div class=\"technique-table-wrap\"><table class=\"technique-inline-table\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Step</th><th scope=\"col\">Question asked</th><th scope=\"col\">Control that answers it</th><th scope=\"col\">Support-agent example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1</strong></td><td>Is this action even part of the approved mission?</td><td>Operating scope + signed goal manifest.</td><td>The agent is allowed to help with support cases, not finance operations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2</strong></td><td>Who is trying to act, and under whose authority?</td><td>Agent identity + delegation lineage + runtime authorization.</td><td>The caller must be <code>support-agent-prod-001</code> or an explicitly authorized delegate.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3</strong></td><td>Is the requested tool, data, environment, and effect inside the approved envelope?</td><td>Authority envelope + action risk classification.</td><td><code>create_ticket</code> in production may be in scope; <code>rotate_credentials</code> is not.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4</strong></td><td>Given current risk, should the action be allowed, supervised, or blocked?</td><td>Runtime trust-state demotion + autonomy narrowing.</td><td>A low-risk KB read is allowed; an outbound email escalates; refund issuance is denied.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5</strong></td><td>If something goes wrong later, can we prove what changed and restore the prior state?</td><td>Goal-manifest provenance + quorum approval + rollback.</td><td>Investigators can see who promoted the current goal and can revert to the previous signed digest.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h5>What teams must lock down</h5><ul><li><strong>Before launch:</strong> approve the operating scope, the per-function autonomy profile, and the authority envelope.</li><li><strong>At runtime:</strong> compute effective action risk and translate it into a concrete oversight mode such as DENY, APPROVE, ESCALATE, NOTIFY, or MONITOR.</li><li><strong>For accountability:</strong> keep agent identity, delegation lineage, goal-manifest provenance, and rollback checkpoints tied to the same control plane.</li></ul><p>The examples in this technique intentionally follow one continuous storyline: <code>support-agent-prod-001</code> is the runtime identity, and <code>support-agent-v3</code> is that agent's approved goal manifest.
